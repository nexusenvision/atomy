- Tenant lifecycle management (create, activate, suspend, reactivate, archive, delete)
- Secure tenant impersonation with audit trails
- Hierarchical tenant support (parent-child relationships)
- Event-driven architecture (9 lifecycle events)
- CQRS-compliant split interfaces

**Actor Types (Excluding Developer):**
- **Platform Administrator** - System-wide platform management
- **Tenant Administrator** - Tenant-level configuration and management
- **Support Staff** - Customer support and tenant assistance
- **Billing Manager** - Subscription and financial operations

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Critical (Must Have)
1. Tenant creation and basic CRUD
2. Status management (activate, suspend, reactivate)
3. Tenant context management
4. Basic tenant resolution (domain/subdomain)

### Phase 2: High Priority
1. Impersonation for support
2. Tenant settings management
3. Trial subscription management
4. Suspension workflow

### Phase 3: Medium Priority
1. Hierarchical tenants
2. Custom domain management
3. Quota management
4. Audit history

### Phase 4: Nice to Have
1. Advanced analytics
2. Bulk operations
3. Tenant backup/restore
4. Advanced reporting

## Notes

### Test Coverage Status
The `Nexus\Tenant` package currently has **0% test coverage** (tests planned for Phase 4 of package development). The test totals in the user stories table represent **planned tests** for application-layer implementation.

### Architectural Compliance
- Package follows **ISP** (Interface Segregation Principle) with split interfaces
- Package follows **CQRS** (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- All services are **stateless** except `TenantContextManager` (request-scoped)
- Package is **framework-agnostic** with zero Laravel dependencies

### Backward Compatibility
- `TenantRepositoryInterface` is deprecated but maintained for backward compatibility
- Migration path provided in `REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md`
- Planned removal in v2.0 (6 months)
