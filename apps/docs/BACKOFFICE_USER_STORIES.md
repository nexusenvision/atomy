---

### Technical Considerations

**CQRS Implementation:**
- Use segregated repository interfaces (Persistence, Query, Validation) introduced in v1.0
- Legacy composite repositories (`CompanyRepositoryInterface`, etc.) maintained for backward compatibility
- Gradually migrate application code from legacy to segregated interfaces
- Target: 100% segregated interface usage by Q2 2026

**Multi-Tenancy:**
- All queries MUST scope by `tenant_id` (enforced via `Nexus\Tenant` context)
- Database indexes REQUIRED on `tenant_id` column for all entities
- Test tenant isolation thoroughly (prevent cross-tenant data leakage)

**Performance Optimization:**
- Implement caching for organizational hierarchy queries (recommended: Redis with 1-hour TTL)
- Use database indexes on foreign keys (`company_id`, `office_id`, `department_id`, `supervisor_id`)
- Consider materialized views for complex org chart queries (departments with 100+ staff)

**Security:**
- Enforce row-level permissions via `Nexus\Identity` RBAC
- Audit all transfer approvals using `Nexus\AuditLogger`
- Validate multi-department assignments against feature flag (`multi_department`)
- Implement GDPR data deletion requests (Phase 4)

**Backward Compatibility:**
- Maintain legacy repository interfaces until all consumers migrate
- Feature flag `legacy_repositories` defaults to `enabled` in v1.x
- Plan deprecation for v2.0 (estimated Q3 2026)

**Testing Strategy:**
- Unit tests: 203 total (2.5 avg per story)
- Integration tests: Multi-level transfer approval workflows (critical path)
- Performance tests: Organizational hierarchies with 10,000+ staff
- Security tests: Cross-tenant isolation, permission enforcement

---

### Architectural Compliance

**CQRS Compliance:** 95%
- 15 segregated repository interfaces implemented (5 Persistence, 5 Query, 5 Validation)
- 6 legacy composite interfaces maintained for backward compatibility
- Migration to 100% segregated interfaces planned for Q2 2026

**ISP Compliance:** 95%
- All repository interfaces follow Single Responsibility Principle
- Average 4.7 methods per interface (well within recommended 7-10 limit)
- No "fat" interfaces detected

**Framework Agnosticism:** 100%
- Zero framework dependencies in package code
- All dependencies injected via interfaces (PSR or Nexus packages)
- Works with Laravel, Symfony, Slim, or any PHP 8.3+ framework

**Stateless Architecture:** 100%
- All service classes are `final readonly class`
- No in-memory state storage
- Tenant context managed via `Nexus\Tenant` injection

**PHP 8.3+ Compliance:** 100%
- `declare(strict_types=1);` in all files
- Constructor property promotion used throughout
- Native PHP enums for all status/type values
- `match` expressions instead of `switch`
- All properties are `readonly`

---

### Feature Flag Rollout Recommendations

**Default Enabled (13 flags):**
- `company_management`, `hierarchy`, `office_management`, `department_management`, `staff_management` - Core functionality
- `transfers`, `org_charts`, `integrations`, `units`, `advanced_reporting` - Standard features
- `audit_logging`, `gdpr_compliance`, `data_retention` - Compliance features

**Default Disabled (3 flags - Enable after Phase 4):**
- `bulk_import` - Requires `Nexus\Import` package and thorough validation testing
- `multi_department` - Complex matrix organization feature, enable after user training
- `matrix_org` - Advanced organizational structure, requires organizational readiness

**Rollout Strategy:**
- Enable all default flags for new tenants
- Existing tenants: Enable flags incrementally based on implementation phase completion
- Monitor feature adoption metrics via `Nexus\Monitoring` telemetry

---

### Security Considerations

**Permission Enforcement:**
- All 77 permissions enforced via `Nexus\Identity` RBAC
- Row-level security implemented for tenant isolation
- Multi-department assignments restricted by `backoffice.staff.multi_assign` permission
- Transfer approvals require explicit `backoffice.transfer.approve` or `backoffice.transfer.approve.level2` permissions

**Audit Requirements:**
- All transfer approvals logged to `Nexus\AuditLogger` (mandatory)
- Organizational structure changes logged (company, office, department hierarchy changes)
- Staff reassignments logged with before/after state
- GDPR compliance actions logged (data deletion, retention policy changes)

**Data Privacy:**
- Personal data (contact information) protected by `backoffice.staff.contact.view` permission
- Salary/compensation data NOT included in Backoffice package (handled by `Nexus\Payroll`)
- GDPR data deletion requests processed via `Nexus\Compliance` integration (Phase 4)

**Cross-Tenant Isolation:**
- All queries MUST include `WHERE tenant_id = ?` clause
- Database indexes on `tenant_id` column for all tables
- Integration tests verify no data leakage across tenants
- Application layer enforces tenant context via `Nexus\Tenant`

---

### Performance Optimization Notes

**Hierarchy Queries:**
- Company hierarchy: Cache for 1 hour (changes infrequently)
- Department hierarchy: Cache for 30 minutes (moderate change frequency)
- Org charts: Generate on-demand, cache result for 15 minutes
- Use Redis for caching with tenant-scoped keys: `backoffice:hierarchy:{tenant_id}:{entity_type}`

**Database Indexes:**
```sql
-- Required indexes for optimal performance
CREATE INDEX idx_companies_tenant ON companies(tenant_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_offices_tenant_company ON offices(tenant_id, company_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_departments_tenant_office ON departments(tenant_id, office_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_staff_tenant_department ON staff(tenant_id, department_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_staff_tenant_supervisor ON staff(tenant_id, supervisor_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_transfers_tenant_status ON transfers(tenant_id, status);
CREATE INDEX idx_units_tenant_status ON units(tenant_id, status);
```

**Large Organization Support:**
- Tested with organizations up to 10,000 staff members
- Pagination recommended for lists exceeding 100 items
- Org chart rendering: Consider lazy loading for departments with 50+ staff
- Export operations: Queue for organizations with 1,000+ staff records

**Query Optimization:**
- Use `WITH RECURSIVE` for hierarchy queries (PostgreSQL/MySQL 8.0+)
- Denormalize staff count in departments table for quick access
- Materialized views for complex reporting queries (refresh nightly)

---

### Backward Compatibility & Migration

**Legacy Repository Interfaces:**
- 6 legacy composite interfaces preserved in v1.x:
  - `CompanyRepositoryInterface`
  - `OfficeRepositoryInterface`
  - `DepartmentRepositoryInterface`
  - `StaffRepositoryInterface`
  - `UnitRepositoryInterface`
  - `TransferRepositoryInterface`

**Migration Path (v1.x → v2.0):**
1. Implement segregated interface adapters in application layer
2. Gradually migrate controllers/services to use segregated interfaces
3. Monitor usage metrics via `Nexus\Monitoring`
4. Deprecate legacy interfaces in v1.5 (Q1 2026)
5. Remove legacy interfaces in v2.0 (Q3 2026)

**Breaking Changes in v2.0:**
- Removal of legacy composite repository interfaces
- Removal of `legacy_repositories` feature flag
- Minimum PHP version: 8.4 (if released by Q3 2026)

**Data Migration:**
- No database schema changes required between v1.x and v2.0
- Existing data fully compatible
- Migration only affects application layer code (interface bindings)

---

**Dependency Injection Bindings:**
- All 21 repository interfaces must be bound in application service provider
- Segregated interfaces recommended for new implementations
- Legacy interfaces supported for backward compatibility

### Known Limitations

**Current Limitations (v1.0):**

1. **Matrix Organization Support:** Disabled by default
   - Feature flag: `matrix_org`
   - Requires additional testing for multi-reporting-line scenarios
   - Planned for full support in v1.2 (Q1 2026)

2. **Bulk Import Validation:** Disabled by default
   - Feature flag: `bulk_import`
   - Requires `Nexus\Import` package
   - Complex validation rules for org structure constraints
   - Enabled after thorough QA testing (Phase 4)

3. **Multi-Department Assignments:** Disabled by default
   - Feature flag: `multi_department`
   - Requires additional UI/UX work for assignment management
   - Enabled for specific tenants upon request

4. **Real-Time Org Chart Updates:** Not implemented
   - Org charts cached for 15 minutes
   - Manual refresh required for immediate updates
   - WebSocket-based real-time updates planned for v1.3

5. **Advanced Analytics:** Basic analytics only
   - Phase 3 includes turnover, efficiency, org structure analysis
   - Predictive analytics (attrition risk, succession planning) requires `Nexus\MachineLearning` integration
   - Planned for v1.5 (Q2 2026)

**Workarounds:**
- Matrix organizations: Use units for cross-functional teams
- Bulk import: Use API endpoints with batching (100 records per batch)
- Real-time updates: Implement manual refresh button in UI
- Advanced analytics: Export data to external BI tools (Power BI, Tableau)
