## Dependencies & Risk Assessment

### External Dependencies
| Dependency | Type | Risk Level | Mitigation |
|------------|------|------------|------------|
| PHP 8.3+ | Language | Low | Standard requirement for modern PHP |
| psr/log | PSR-3 Interface | Low | Widely adopted standard |

### Internal Package Dependencies
