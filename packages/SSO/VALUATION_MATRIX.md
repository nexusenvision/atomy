## Intellectual Property Value

### IP Classification
- **Patent Potential:** Low
- **Trade Secret Status:** The specific integration patterns and framework-agnostic architecture are proprietary.
- **Copyright:** Original code and documentation are copyrighted.
- **Licensing Model:** MIT

### Proprietary Value
- **Unique Algorithms:** The state management and callback validation logic is highly specific to the Nexus ecosystem.
- **Domain Expertise Required:** Deep knowledge of SSO protocols and PHP architecture.
- **Barrier to Entry:** High. Replicating this level of integration and quality would be time-consuming.

| league/oauth2-client | Library | Low | Industry-standard library, very stable. Abstracted via interface. |

### Internal Package Dependencies
- **Depends On:** `Nexus\Tenant`, `Nexus\AuditLogger`, `Nexus\Monitoring` (via interfaces)
- **Depended By:** `Nexus\Identity` (conceptually), any application-level code.
- **Coupling Risk:** Low, due to contract-driven design.

### Maintenance Risk
- **Bus Factor:** 2 developers
