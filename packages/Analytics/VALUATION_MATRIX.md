# Valuation Matrix: Analytics

**Package:** `Nexus\Analytics`  
**Category:** Business Logic (Core Analytics Engine)  
**Valuation Date:** 2024-11-24  
**Status:** Production Ready

## Executive Summary

**Package Purpose:** Framework-agnostic analytics query execution engine for multi-dimensional business intelligence with row-level security.

**Business Value:** Provides comprehensive analytics capabilities including multi-dimensional analysis, drill-down/drill-up, filtering, grouping, aggregation, and row-level security (guards). Enables data-driven decision-making across all business domains.

**Market Comparison:** Comparable to commercial BI platforms like Tableau Server ($70/user/month), Power BI Premium ($20/user/month), or Looker ($3,000/month base + per-user fees). Open-source alternatives include Apache Superset (lacks row-level security engine), Metabase (limited multi-dimensional analysis).
