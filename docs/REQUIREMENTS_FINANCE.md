# Requirements: Finance (Atomic Package Layer)

**Package:** `Nexus\Finance`  
**Version:** 2.0 (Refined for Atomic Package Architecture)  
**Last Updated:** November 24, 2025  
**Total Requirements:** 85 (Refined from 194 original)

## Package Boundary Definition

This requirements document defines the **atomic package layer** for `Nexus\Finance` - a stateless, framework-agnostic general ledger and journal entry management engine.

### What Belongs in Package Layer (This Document)

- ✅ **Validation Logic**: Balance checks, hierarchy rules, period validation logic
- ✅ **Calculation Algorithms**: Account balance computation, trial balance generation, exchange rate conversion
- ✅ **Business Rules**: Double-entry enforcement, immutability rules, account type inheritance
- ✅ **Entity Contracts**: Interfaces defining AccountInterface, JournalEntryInterface, etc.
- ✅ **Value Object Immutability**: Money, ExchangeRate, JournalEntryNumber specifications
- ✅ **Core Engine Logic**: PostingEngine validation, BalanceCalculator algorithms
- ✅ **Interface Dependencies**: Contracts for Period validation, Sequencing, AuditLogger integration

### What Belongs in Application Layer (Consuming Application Responsibility)

- ❌ **Database Schema**: Migrations, table definitions, indexes, foreign keys
- ❌ **ORM Models**: Eloquent models, query builders, database transactions
- ❌ **API Endpoints**: REST routes, controllers, request validation, authentication
- ❌ **Caching Strategies**: Cache TTL, Redis configuration, cache invalidation
- ❌ **Transaction Management**: Database ACID compliance, pessimistic locking, rollback handling
- ❌ **UI Components**: Autocomplete widgets, real-time updates, warning dialogs
- ❌ **Orchestration**: Workflow approval routing, webhook notifications, retry logic
- ❌ **Authorization**: RBAC policies, permission checks, user authentication
- ❌ **Deployment Tiers**: Small/medium/large business configurations, scaling strategies

### Architectural References

- **Core Principles**: `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- **Architecture Guidelines**: `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **Package Reference**: `docs/NEXUS_PACKAGES_REFERENCE.md`

## Eliminated Requirements Summary

**Original Requirements:** 194  
**Refined Requirements:** 85  
**Eliminated:** 109

**Elimination Breakdown:**
- **42** Duplicate requirements (same statement repeated 2-3 times)
- **35** Application layer concerns (Eloquent models, migrations, API routes, authorization)
- **18** Orchestration concerns (database transactions, pessimistic locking, caching, retries)
- **8** UI/UX features (autocomplete, widgets, real-time updates)
- **6** Deployment tier specifications (small/medium/large business configurations)

**Rationale:** Eliminated requirements are the responsibility of the consuming application per Nexus architectural principles of framework-agnostic, stateless atomic packages.

## Notes

### Requirement Refinement Methodology

This requirements document was refined from 194 original requirements using the following methodology:

1. **Duplication Elimination**: Merged 42 duplicate requirements with identical statements
2. **Application Layer Separation**: Removed 35 requirements specific to ORM, migrations, API routes, authorization
3. **Orchestration Concerns Removal**: Eliminated 18 requirements for database transactions, locking, caching, retry logic
4. **UI/UX Exclusion**: Removed 8 requirements for frontend widgets, autocomplete, real-time updates
5. **Deployment Agnostic**: Eliminated 6 requirements specific to small/medium/large business tiers
6. **Package Perspective Rewrite**: Reframed remaining requirements to focus on business logic, validation rules, and interface contracts

### Architectural Compliance

All requirements in this document adhere to Nexus architectural principles:

- ✅ **Framework-Agnostic**: No Laravel, Symfony, or framework-specific dependencies
- ✅ **Contract-Driven**: All persistence and integration via interfaces
- ✅ **Stateless**: No mutable class properties, all state externalized
- ✅ **Algorithmic Focus**: Performance defined by complexity class (O(n), O(log n)), not database timings
- ✅ **Interface Dependencies**: External packages referenced only via interfaces (PeriodValidatorInterface, not PeriodManager)
- ✅ **Value Object Immutability**: All domain values (Money, ExchangeRate) are readonly

### Future Enhancements (Not in Scope)

The following capabilities may be added in future versions but are not required for core functionality:

- Advanced allocation rules for distributing amounts across accounts
- Budget vs actual comparison logic (belongs in Nexus\Budget package)
- Recurring journal entry scheduling (application layer orchestration)
- Account templates for industry-specific COA (application layer seed data)
- Consolidation eliminations (may require dedicated Nexus\Consolidation package)
