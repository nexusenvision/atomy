## Architectural Highlights

### 1. Framework Agnosticism
All packages follow strict separation:
- **Packages**: Pure PHP business logic, contracts, value objects
- **Application Layer**: Laravel-specific implementations (models, migrations, repositories)

### 2. Modern PHP 8.3+ Features
- Native enums with backed values and business logic methods
- Readonly properties for immutability
- Constructor property promotion
- Match expressions instead of switch
- Strict type declarations

### 3. Value Objects for Domain Integrity
- `Money`: Immutable, 4-decimal precision, currency safety
- `PeriodDateRange`: Date range validation
- `ProcessingResult`: OCR confidence tracking

### 4. Clear Exception Hierarchies
Each package has a base exception and specific exceptions for domain errors, making error handling predictable and debuggable.

### 5. Event Sourcing Strategy
EventStream is OPTIONAL and ONLY for critical domains (Finance GL, Inventory) where state replay is required for compliance. All other domains use standard AuditLogger for timeline feeds.

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: Scope Creep
**Mitigation**: Focus on MVP functionality first. Implement small/medium business features before enterprise features.

### Risk 2: Performance
**Mitigation**: Period validation must be < 5ms as it's called for every transaction. Use aggressive caching and database indexing.

### Risk 3: Complex Dependencies
**Mitigation**: Clear dependency hierarchy established. Period → Finance → Accounting/Payable/Receivable.

### Risk 4: Multi-Currency Complexity
**Mitigation**: Money value object handles currency safety. ExchangeRate value object manages conversions.

### Risk 5: Event Sourcing Complexity
**Mitigation**: EventStream is optional for small/medium businesses. Only implement for large enterprises.

## Conclusion

The architectural foundation is solid. Core contracts and value objects demonstrate proper design patterns. The remaining work is primarily:
1. Service implementation (business logic)
2. Application layer (database, models, repositories)
3. API routes
4. Testing and security

The modular design allows parallel development of packages once dependencies are resolved.
