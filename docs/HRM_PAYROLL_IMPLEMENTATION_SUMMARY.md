## Architecture Compliance

### ✅ Core Principles Followed

1. **Logic in Packages, Implementation in Applications**
   - All business logic in atomic packages (Hrm, Payroll, PayrollMysStatutory)
   - Laravel-specific implementations in apps/consuming application

2. **Framework Agnosticism**
   - Packages have no Laravel dependencies
   - All Laravel specifics (Eloquent, migrations, controllers) in application layer

3. **Contract-Driven Design**
   - OrganizationServiceContract bridges HRM with Backoffice
   - StatutoryCalculatorInterface enables multi-country payroll
   - All repository operations via interfaces

4. **Modern PHP 8.3+ Standards**
   - Constructor property promotion with `readonly` modifier
   - Native enums for value objects
   - `match` expressions instead of `switch`
   - Type hints on all parameters and returns
   - `declare(strict_types=1);` on all files

5. **Multi-Country Support**
   - Registry pattern for statutory calculators
   - Malaysia calculator as separate atomic package
   - Easy to add Singapore/Indonesia/other countries

2. [ ] Install Malaysia statutory package in consuming application: `composer require nexus/payroll-mys-statutory:"*@dev"`
3. [ ] Create API routes in `routes/api.php` for all controllers
4. [ ] Run `composer dump-autoload` to register new classes
5. [ ] Test all API endpoints using Postman or similar
6. [ ] Write unit tests for critical paths
7. [ ] Update REQUIREMENTS.csv with implementation status
8. [ ] Create PR with detailed description

### Post-Merge Actions

1. [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
2. [ ] Performance testing for payroll processing (5,000 employees)
3. [ ] Load testing for concurrent API requests
4. [ ] Security audit for sensitive data handling
5. [ ] User acceptance testing with HR and payroll teams
6. [ ] Generate API client libraries (optional)

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Limitations

1. **Repositories Not Yet Implemented:** Controllers call service managers, but actual repository implementations for HRM entities (leave, attendance, performance review, disciplinary, training) are pending.

2. **Database Migrations:** HRM migrations for new entities (performance review, disciplinary, training) need to be created.

3. **PCB Calculation:** Simplified MTD method used. Production system needs full LHDN PCB calculation with all tax relief categories.

4. **SOCSO Age Restrictions:** Age-based SOCSO eligibility (60 years) not yet implemented in calculator.

5. **Workflow Integration:** Leave approvals and disciplinary workflows currently use inline approval logic instead of Nexus\Workflow package.

6. **API Routes:** Route definitions not yet created in `routes/api.php`.

### Future Enhancements

1. Add Singapore CPF/SDL statutory calculator (SingaporeStatutoryCalculator)
2. Add Indonesia BPJS/PPh 21 statutory calculator
3. Implement full LHDN tax relief categories (insurance, EPF, education, etc.)
4. Add EA Form generation for annual tax filing
5. Add payslip PDF generation
6. Add bulk payroll processing with batch queue
7. Add payroll export to bank payment format (GIRO)
8. Add automatic email notifications for payslips
9. Implement salary revision workflows
10. Add comprehensive reporting (payroll summary, tax reports, statutory reports)
